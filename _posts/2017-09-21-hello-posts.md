This is my very first post, and I'm very glad about it. Actually, I already wrote
my first story on Medium about three weeks ago, but only now I'm announcing it
here.

My first story may be seem as a _meta_ story as it tells _why_ I've decided
to start writing. The main motivations and interests that led me to starting a
blog (can I call it a blog?) are somewhat described there.

From now on, I intend to follow this pattern. First, I write the story on Medium,
publish it and then I link it here. This way I avoid duplicating text here and
there and make Medium my main blog system. I do hope it works :)

Ok, the link to my first story is here - [Why I've decided to start
writing](https://medium.com/@kazukiyokoyama/why-ive-decided-to-start-writing-af861576642a).

Thanks for reading!
