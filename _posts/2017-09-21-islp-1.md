Hi!

I'm glad to announce that the first part of the ISLP series is available on Medium.

ISLP is a series of Jupyter notebooks that attempts to translate the labs of the
book _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_ by James Gareth,
Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani from the R language to Python.
Hence, I called it _Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python_ - ISLP.

The first lab is a soft introduction to Python and its scientific environment.
The idea is to provide a Python version of the original labs for those who have
ever had the curiosity to explore the book's content with Python code. Further
details are given in the story.

The link to the story is here - [ISLP Part 1 - Introduction to Python](https://medium.com/@kazukiyokoyama/islp-part-1-introduction-to-python-fbe6c4930ada)

Thanks for reading!
