<center>Hello, everybody! I'm Kazuki Yokoyama.</center>

I'm a data scientist and software engineer in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I'm also a MSc student in computer
science and an undergraduate student in applied and computational mathematics at
Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS. I hold a bachelor's degree in
computer engineering as well.

My technical interests include data science, machine learning and computational statistics.
I'm currently studying anomaly detection techniques using statistical methods especially
in the high dimensional and non-parametric setting.

On the hacking side, I code mostly in Python and R. But C, Java and Ruby are
also in my programming languages list. I really enjoy writing code other
people may find useful and reusable and so I spend some time reading about
software engineering and frameworks.

Last but not least, I have two incredible dogs! The wieners are called
Caramelo and Chocolate :)

Thanks for reading!
